Karima Jackson is </strong><strong>an American philanthropist and research scholar who was born on February 17, 1994.</strong></p><p>Karima is one of the five children born to the entertainment bigshot but she hasn’t shown any interest in joining the Hollywood train. Interestingly, she is not the only member of her family who is not interested in carrying on their father’s legacy in the entertainment industry. Out of Ice Cube’s five kids, only two have been noted to tread his career path. Nevertheless, he seems to be very proud of their achievements in different fields of endeavors.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Karima Jackson’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Karima Jackson</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> February 17, 1994</li><li><strong>Karima Jackson’s Age:</strong> 29 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> African-American</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign</strong> Aquarius</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Engaged</li><li><strong>Karima Jackson’s Partner:</strong> Horatio Joines</li><li><strong>Karima Jackson’s Parents:</strong> Ice Cube and Kimberly Woodruff</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Deja Jackson, Shareef Jackson, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Darrell Jackson</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> being Ice Cube’s daughter</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old is Karima Jackson?</strong></h2><p>Karima Jackson is 29 years old. She was born on February 17, 1994, in Los Angeles, California. She was welcomed into the family of American rapper, writer, and actor O’Shea Jackson Sr., popularly known as Ice Cube, and his wife Kimberly Woodruff. Karima is the third child born into the family and she has two younger ones.</p><p>Karima is quite a scholar with a shiny portfolio in the academic world. Though her early educational background is not public knowledge, she has bagged a college degree and added two masters to it.</p><p>Upon completing her studies in sociology at Rutgers University-New Brunswick, Karima bagged her first degree. However, a bachelor’s degree wasn’t enough for her as she went on to earn a master’s degree in child advocacy from Montclair State University. Her first master’s focussed on public child welfare and she still went back for another one, this time she got a master’s degree in public administration from Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey-Newark.</p><p>During her studies for her second master’s degree, Karima was a Pi Alpha Alpha member. She used the opportunity to follow her passion for doing charity work, helping to make the world a better place in her own way. The youngster is currently pursuing her Ph.D. at Rutgers University SPAA.</p><h2><strong>What Does Karima Jackson Do For a Living?</strong></h2><p>Karima currently works as a research fellow at the Rutgers School of Public Affairs and Administration (SPAA) but her career started long before she even earned a college degree. The bulk of her work history is rooted in the charity field as she has vowed to dedicate her life to serving humanity.</p><p>While in college studying for her bachelor’s degree, Karima became an assistant program director when she joined St. John’s Community Services (SJCS), one of the oldest charity organizations founded in Washington D.C.</p><p>Her next career exploit was under the State of New Jersey where she served as a family service specialist (II) and was later promoted to the level of family service specialist (I). Karima later rose to the rank of family service supervisor due to her dedication to the cause.</p><p>She is also the founder of a charity organization herself. Aside from working with already established organizations to help people, she started her own charity outfit in 2014 called Organize Change, Inc. where she serves as the executive director while also studying for her doctorate. She also contributes as a member of the Anti-Racist Alliance-North Jersey.</p><p>While she might not be living under the spotlight like her father and some of her siblings, the young lady has done a great job in carving her own identity as a charity worker and research scholar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/jackson-family-1572520133249.jpg><h2><strong>Who is Karima Jackson’s Mom?</strong></h2><p>Karima Jackson’s mom is Kimberly Woodruff, who has been married to her father Ice Cube since 1992. Unlike Karima’s father who is a legend in the American entertainment industry and beyond, her mom does not have any known career, especially in the showbiz industry. Her only claim to fame is her marriage to Ice Cube.</p><p>Karima dedicated her life to raising her kids while supporting her husband’s career in every way she could. The couple have remained one of the admired ones in Hollywood and they are still looking good together.</p><h2><strong>Are Karima and Deja Jackson Twins?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Deja-Jackson-Wiki-e1648884392586.jpg><p>Deja Jackson is the only sister Karima has and they are actually twins if the information available about her is true. Deja is one of the lesser-known children of Ice Cube and she has very scanty details available about her life and career.</p><p>However, there are claims that she was born on February 17, 1994, the same day Karima was born. This suggests that they are twins but it seems Karima is the older one. Apart from Deja, Karima’s other siblings are Shareef Jackson, O’Shea Jackson Jr., and Darrell Jackson, all brothers. The older ones O’Shea and Darrel are the ones following their father’s footsteps in the entertainment industry.</p><h2><strong>Karima Jackson is in a Relationship with Horatio Joines</strong></h2><p>Ice Cube’s daughter Karima Jackson is not married yet but she is in a committed relationship with a man named Horatio Joines and they have plans of getting married soon. Like Karima, Horatio is not involved in the entertainment industry and he is heavily invested in the charity world. Their love for charity and helping humanity is the biggest thing they have in common.</p><p>The lovebirds work together in Karima Organize Change Inc. where Joines is a member. It is their dedication to noble causes that brought them together and they are known to support each other in their philanthropic endeavors.</p><p>The young couple made the news sometime in 2016 following an altercation with Newark Cemetry’s board member Warren Vincentz. Horatio actually punched Warren in the face after Karima reported her issue with the board while trying to carry out her Clean up Woodland Cemetry campaign in the city.</p><p>The matter was reported to the police as well and has now been resolved. Karima and Horatio are still going strong and wedding bells are expected from their corner any moment now. She is not an active user of any social media platform which makes it hard to follow up on her personal life and the same goes for her boyfriend but all things being equal, the two are a match made in heaven.</p><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h3><strong>Who is Karima Jackson?</strong></h3><p>Karima Jackson is the daughter of renowned American rapper Ice Cube and his wife, Kimberly Woodruff.
