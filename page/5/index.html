This premium spirit pays heritage to a centuries-old distilling process, providing an unique taste experience you’ll want to share with friends and family this holiday season whether in person or virtually.
Derived from the Spanish word meaning ‘wolves,’ and dedicated to the strength of a pack, what sets Lobos 1707 apart are that its spirits are distilled with traditional Mexican aging but finished in wine barrels from Spain, representing a modern approach to a practice that was created over 400 years ago.
