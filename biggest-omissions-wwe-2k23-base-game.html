However, while there are tons of legends and current stars that people can choose from, not everybody made the cut for the base game that people can buy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>WWE 2K23: 10 Lowest Rated Wrestlers In The Game, Ranked</a></span></p><p>While some wrestlers can be added at a later date via downloadable content that gamers have to pay extra money for, that's not the case for all of them. Some people don't want to do that either, therefore those missing from the base game will just be missed by some people, and there are some big omissions.</p><h2 id=candice-lerae><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Candice LeRae</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Candice-LeRae.jfif><p>It is quite surprising that Candice LeRae hasn't made the cut for the game this year because Johnny Gargano is part of it. While both of them weren't around the whole time in the past year, the fact that Gargano was added in and LeRae wasn't is a strange decision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Secrets & Easter Eggs You May Have Missed In WWE 2K23</a></span></p><p>Considering she has been in previous games there would have been less effort involved in putting LeRae into this one, but that wasn't the decision that got made. On top of that, LeRae is also not part of any planned DLCs, so it seems like she simply won't be involved this time.</p><h2 id=naomi><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Naomi</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Naomi-working-with-Marvel-Cropped.jpg><p><a href=#>Naomi is one of the biggest names</a> in WWE's women's roster but she hasn't been seen since she and Sasha Banks walked out on the company, it does make sense that she hasn't been included. WWE likely pushed for this on the chance that she doesn't return.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, because she is technically on the roster still there's no doubt that Naomi is a major omission from the game as she's a popular part of the roster. Fans would love to be able to use her, but the fact Naomi isn't part of the game isn't a good sign for her future.</p><h2 id=bray-wyatt><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Bray Wyatt</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bray-wyatt-wwe-injury.jpg><p>Bray Wyatt has been confirmed for a future DLC pack, meaning he will be available to play at a later date. However, when it comes to the base game the <a href=#>former Universal Champion</a> will not be an option, despite the fact he is one of the biggest names in the entire company.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>WWE 2K23: 10 Highest Rated Wrestlers In The Game, Ranked</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wyatt is someone fans would love to choose from due to the fact audiences have a big connection to him, and he doesn't wrestle all that much. People would be able to bring his epic entrance to life and put him with wrestlers they don't normally see, but that won't be possible with the base game alone.</p><h2 id=dusty-rhodes><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Dusty Rhodes</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/dusty-rhodes-polka-dots-wwe.jpg><p>Dusty Rhodes is a well-known legend from WWE's history and someone who is typically available to choose from. However, that isn't the case this time around, and that is a very surprising situation considering the fact <a href=#>Cody Rhodes is one of the biggest names</a> in the game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>2K has made a big deal of featuring the American Nightmare in the game, and they were well aware of how often he mentions his father during promos. Therefore the fact Dusty isn't part of the game is a very surprising decision as fans would likely want to put them together as a team or even as opponents.</p><h2 id=hit-row><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Hit Row</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Collage-Maker-12-Aug-2022-0932-PM.jpg><p>Hit Row were brought back to WWE by Triple H, and the three of them have been heavily featured on television ever since. While they might not be one of the focal points of the storylines, the three of them are still big names on the main roster.</p><p>However, they are not part of the base game, likely because they returned to WWE slightly too late. But there is good news for fans who want to play as Hit Row because they will be added as DLC at a later date.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=roderick-strong><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Roderick Strong</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Roderick-Strong-Daimond-Mine.jpg><p>The NXT roster is heavily featured in the new game with some of the bigger stars and many of the upcoming names for the future being part of it. However, one notable omission is Roderick Strong, who is one of the most recognizable names on the brand right now.</p><p>Considering his years of work in WWE and the fact he was a member of <a href=#>the Undisputed Era</a>, it is a big surprise that he isn't part of the game. However, with rumors about his future being rampant, it could be a sign that his long-term future might not be with the company.</p><h2 id=cm-punk><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>CM Punk</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/custom-dimensions-1400x700-px-73.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is understandable as to why CM Punk isn't part of the video game due to his history with WWE and the fact he is under contract with AEW right now. However, the main focus of the new game is being able to play through John Cena's career and ultimately <a href=#>Punk was a huge part of that</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>9 New Features In WWE 2K23 That Gamers Should Know About</a></span></p><p>Some of Cena's biggest moments just so happen to feature Punk as his rival as he had a big role in the storyline involving The Rock which is part of the game. Because of that, Punk is an obvious omission, no matter how much it makes sense.</p><h2 id=ric-flair><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Ric Flair</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ric-flair-cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Arguably the biggest omission from the game is <a href=#>the Nature Boy</a>, Ric Flair. He is one of the greatest wrestlers of all time and a major legend that is well-known by casual fans, therefore the fact he isn't part of the game is a major surprise.</p><p>While Flair did have a few periods recently where he wasn't on the best terms with WWE, that usually doesn't stop 2K from adding people into the games. However, this time around Flair isn't going to be part of the game, which is a huge omission.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeSnrSosdKtZKilmajAqrvNrGSwr5Vif6x%2BkmaZmquVYrSiucRo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbiggest-omissions-wwe-2k23-base-game.html&text=8%20Biggest%20Omissions%20From%20The%20WWE%202K23%20Base%20Game&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbiggest-omissions-wwe-2k23-base-game.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbiggest-omissions-wwe-2k23-base-game.html&title=8%20Biggest%20Omissions%20From%20The%20WWE%202K23%20Base%20Game" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbiggest-omissions-wwe-2k23-base-game.html&title=8%20Biggest%20Omissions%20From%20The%20WWE%202K23%20Base%20Game" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbiggest-omissions-wwe-2k23-base-game.html&title=8%20Biggest%20Omissions%20From%20The%20WWE%202K23%20Base%20Game" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbiggest-omissions-wwe-2k23-base-game.html&description=8%20Biggest%20Omissions%20From%20The%20WWE%202K23%20Base%20Game" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gh-spoilers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="General Hospital Spoilers: GH Secret Real-Life Couple Opens Up  Co-Stars Vinessa Antoine and Anth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-is-a-takuache-slang.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is a takuache slang">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
