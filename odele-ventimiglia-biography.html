However, Odele was a mother but it is not known who is the father of her daughter Shiloh.</p><p>We believe that Odele got separated from her partner when she got pregnant because her mother has not stated in her Instagram post anything about Odele’s husband. In the last few months, Odele has not shared any pictures of her sitting with her husband. She celebrated her daughter’s birth with her parents and sister only. No person believes to be there at the time of Shiloh’s birth who may claim that he is her father.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Daughter_Son_Relationships></span><strong>Daughter, Son & Relationships</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Marital Status</strong></td><td>Married (Unconfirmed)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Husband</strong></td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Relationship Status</strong></td><td>Married (Unconfirmed)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Boyfriend</strong></td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Son(s)</strong></td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Daughter</strong></td><td>Shiloh</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Odele-Ventimiglia-career.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span><strong>Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When we researched Odele Ventimiglia’s profiles on Google we found her LinkedIn profile and profile created on Harri.com.
